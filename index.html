                    Hello! My name is Justin Pihowich. This is a personal website created by me to act as in all-in-one profile with links to any platforms I use. It is a running work in progress that I am continuing to create.
                    <br>
                    This current page is under construction currently.
                    <br>
                    If you are seeing this website now, it is not fully complete yet and lacks major CSS modification. Hopefully in the coming days, it will look more modern with more interactivity.
