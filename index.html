                    <div>Hello! My name is Justin Pihowich</div>
                    <div>This is a personal website created by me to act as in all-in-one profile with links to any platforms I use.</div>
                    <div>Initially it was created to just be a resume website, but I desire to turn it into a personal website.</div>
                    <div>It is a running work in progress that I am continuing to create.</div>
                    <div>Currently the only page is my slightly interactive resume page.</div>
                    <div>If you are seeing this website now, my hope is for this to show only the most basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</div>
                    <div>Hopefully when I find time in the near future, it will blossom with CSS</div>
